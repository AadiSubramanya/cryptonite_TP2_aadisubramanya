# Trivial Flag Transfer Protocol

**Flag:** `picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_pLa1n_S1GHT_18375919`

How I approached the challenge:

- step 1

```
After looking at the extension of the file and doing some research into what pcapng files are, I got to know that you can access
it using tools like wireshark
```

- step 2

```
Upon opening and extracting as tftp (as the file is named) using wireshark, I got a folder that had multiple files under it
like so:
```

```
Then I opened the instructions and got encrypted text. It looked like shifted encryption soI just tried rot13 decryption and 
it worked
```

```
I just tried rot13 decryption and it worked
```

- step 3

```
The plain text told me to go back to plan, so I then opened plan file through hexa d editor and again got encrypted text 
like so:
```

```
Again tried rot13 decryption and it worked.

- step 4

```
The text told me it hid stuff using the program, I tried running the program using terminal:
Since it didnt work I tried to install it. When I asked chat gpt what the error was when it was installing it told me:
```

- step 2

```
Finally after installing using the steghide command I was able to reveal the hidden data in one of the images like so:
```

- etc.

What I learned through solving this challenge:

1. What is a .pcapng file and how to extract it (using applications like wireshark)
2. How to reveal hidden data in images using steghide

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- Trying to run the .deb program directly with pictures as argument.
