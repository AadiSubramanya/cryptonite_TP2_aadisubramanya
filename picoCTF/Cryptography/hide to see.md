# hide to see

**Flag:** `picoCTF{atbash_crack_92533667}`

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1

```
After a bunch of fiddling with the image I tried to search online on how data can be hidden in an image, and remembered about steghide.
So I ran steghide on it and after bunch of trial and error I got something on putting nothing as the password

- step 2

```
It looked ciphered again so I ran it through atbash cipher like the image said and i got the flag!
```

- etc.
