# C3

**Flag:** `picoCTF{adlibs}`

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1

```
Firstly, analyzed the given code and reversed it to decrypt the given cipher text like follows:

- step 2

```
On running this, I was given a string output like follows:

```
It looks like another python script which takes itself as input, so I switched over to terminal to run this.
```

- step 3

```
After a bunch of trial and error I was able to figure out how to make it work, and was finally given a peculiar text "adlibs". (which was actually the flag but i tried bunch of decryption techniques thinking flag cant be so small lol, eventually just put this as the flag and was so frustrated!)

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. what "self-input" means

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- A lot of incorrect ways of self-inputting 
- Trying to overcomplicate things by further decrypting the given text

- none
