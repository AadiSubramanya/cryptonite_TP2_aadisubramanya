How you approached the challenge:

- step 1

```
Observed the code and got to know that this is very very similar to rsa encryption...
I remember searching online on how to solve similar problems and often came across codes that solved this

So I used that code (which uses inverse function and logic i dont understand __filL logic in simple words__), replacing the values in the different places and modifying/adjusting the code as needed to get my desired number sequuence of number which was 1224543274432953164098494823673082544474888158727042278518055942472603042171050926269717319080882631327061394998314354487201417153661

- step 2

```
Just used long_to_bytes() to get the byte expression of that number and there it was!
