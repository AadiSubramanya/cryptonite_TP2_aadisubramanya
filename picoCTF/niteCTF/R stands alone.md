### How I Solved the Challenge

#### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
When I first saw the challenge, it looked very similar to RSA encryption. I remembered from my previous studies that RSA works by using a pair of keys â€“ a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. 

To solve this, I needed to:
1. Find the modular inverse of the public exponent `e` (which is usually 65537) to get the private key exponent `d`.
2. Use this private key to decrypt the given message.

#### Step 2: Breaking It Down
I quickly found that the process was simple if I followed these steps:
1. **Modular Inverse:** The key to decrypting the message is finding `d`, which is the modular inverse of `e`. This means `d` satisfies the equation:  
   \[
   e \cdot d \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ (N-1))
   \]
   I used the `inverse` function from Python's `Crypto.Util.number` to calculate this.

2. **Decrypting the Message:** Once I had `d`, I could use it to decrypt the message using modular exponentiation, which essentially reverses the encryption.

Hereâ€™s the Python code I used to decrypt the message:

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import inverse, long_to_bytes

# Given values
right_side = 583923134770560329725969597854974954817875793223201855918544947864454662723867635785399659016709076642873878052382188776671557362982072671970362761186980877612369359390225243415378728776179883524295537607691571827283702387054497203051018081864728864347679606523298343320899830775463739426749812898275755128789910670953110189932506526059469355433776101712047677552

e = 65537

# Step 1: Find the modular inverse of e mod (N-1)
phi_N = N - 1
e_inv = inverse(e, phi_N)

# Step 2: Decrypt the message using modular exponentiation
x = pow(right_side, e_inv, N)
print(f"x = {x}")

# Convert the result to bytes and print the flag
flag = long_to_bytes(x)
print(f"Flag: {flag.decode()}")

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1

```
Observed the code and got to know that this is very very similar to rsa encryption...
I remember searching online on how to solve similar problems and often came across python code that solved this

So I used that code (which uses inverse function and logic i dont understand __filL logic in simple words__), replacing the values in the different places and modifying/adjusting the code as needed to get my desired number sequuence of number which was 1224543274432953164098494823673082544474888158727042278518055942472603042171050926269717319080882631327061394998314354487201417153661

- step 2

```
Just used long_to_bytes() to get the byte expression of that number and there it was!
