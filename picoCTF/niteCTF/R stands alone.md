# R STANDS ALONE

### SOLUTION

First,
Observed the code and got to know that this is very very similar to rsa encryption.
I remember searching online on how to solve similar problems and often came across python code that solved this

So I analyzed that code and knew I needed to:
1. Find the modular inverse of the public exponent `e` to get the private key exponent `d`
2. Use this private key to decrypt the given message


Next,
I just followed these steps I learnt earlier from reference code to solve the problem

1. **Modular Inverse:** The key to decrypting the message is finding `d`, which is the modular inverse of `e`. This means `d` satisfies the equation:  
   I used the `mod_inverse` function from `sympy` module (unlike the Crypto.Util.number like mentioned in reference code, because i had used this earlier) to calculate this.

2. **Decrypting the Message:** Once I had `d`, I could use it to decrypt the message using modular exponentiation, which actually reverses the encryption

```python

```


Finally, 
```
Just used long_to_bytes() to get the byte expression of that number and there it was!
