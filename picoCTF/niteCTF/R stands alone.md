### How I Solved the Challenge:

#### Step 1: Identifying the Problem Type
When I analyzed the challenge, it immediately reminded me of RSA encryption due to the modular arithmetic operations involving large numbers. I had previously studied how RSA works and recalled that reversing RSA encryption requires calculating the modular inverse of the public exponent `e`. 

With this understanding, I knew I needed to:
1. Compute the modular inverse of `e` with respect to `Ï†(N)` (or `(N - 1)` in this case).  
2. Use the inverse to decrypt the ciphertext.  

#### Step 2: Implementing the Solution
Using my knowledge, I crafted a Python script to perform the decryption. Here's the process broken down:

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation**  
   The private key exponent `d` is computed using the modular inverse formula:  
   \[
   d = e^{-1} \mod \phi(N)
   \]
   I used the `Crypto.Util.number.inverse` function to calculate this efficiently.

2. **Decrypting the Ciphertext**  
   Once `d` was calculated, I used modular exponentiation to decrypt the given ciphertext:  
   \[
   x = \text{right\_side}^{d} \mod N
   \]

   Here's the Python code I used for this step:
   ```python
   from Crypto.Util.number import inverse, long_to_bytes

   # Given values
   right_side = 583923134770560329725969597854974954817875793223201855918544947864454662723867635785399659016709076642873878052382188776671557362982072671970362761186980877612369359390225243415378728776179883524295537607691571827283702387054497203051018081864728864347679606523298343320899830775463739426749812898275755128789910670953110189932506526059469355433776101712047677552
   N = 17089720847522532186100904495372954796086523439343401190123572243129905753474678094845069878902485935983903151003792259885100719816542256646921114782358850654669422154056281086124314106159053995410679203972646861293990837092569959353563829625357193304859110289832087486433404114502776367901058316568043039359702726129176232071380909102959487599545443427656477659826199871583221432635475944633756787715120625352578949312795012083097635951710463898749012187679742033
   e = 65537

   # Step 1: Compute modular inverse of e mod (N-1)
   phi_N = N - 1
   e_inv = inverse(e, phi_N)

   # Step 2: Compute x using modular exponentiation
   x = pow(right_side, e_inv, N)
   print(f"x = {x}")

   # Convert the result to bytes and print the flag
   flag = long_to_bytes(x)
   print(f"Flag: {flag.decode()}")

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1

```
Observed the code and got to know that this is very very similar to rsa encryption...
I remember searching online on how to solve similar problems and often came across python code that solved this

So I used that code (which uses inverse function and logic i dont understand __filL logic in simple words__), replacing the values in the different places and modifying/adjusting the code as needed to get my desired number sequuence of number which was 1224543274432953164098494823673082544474888158727042278518055942472603042171050926269717319080882631327061394998314354487201417153661

- step 2

```
Just used long_to_bytes() to get the byte expression of that number and there it was!
