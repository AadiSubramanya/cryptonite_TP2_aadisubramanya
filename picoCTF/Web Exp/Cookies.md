**Flag:** `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}`

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1

```
Since the challenge was named cookies, I went to the cookies section in inspect element and found a cooked whose value was and int and could be changed.
```

- step 2

```
Brute forced from big values all the way down untll i found that 25 was the max cookie value that was giving any valid results.

Again brute forced from 25 to 0 untill at 18 I got the desired flag
